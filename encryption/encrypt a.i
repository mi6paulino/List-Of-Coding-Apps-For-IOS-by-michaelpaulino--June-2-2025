To develop an advanced application like VIGI A.I, which involves crime prediction and cyber crime prevention, it's crucial to use encrypted databases to protect sensitive information. Below are some examples and methods for using encrypted databases in your application.


Encrypted Database Examples

1. SQL Server with Always Encrypted

Microsoft SQL Server offers a feature called Always Encrypted, which ensures that sensitive data is always encrypted, both at rest and in transit. This feature allows client applications to encrypt sensitive data before passing it to the Database Engine, ensuring that the data remains secure.


Example:



-- Enable Always Encrypted for a column
CREATE TABLE Patients (
    PatientID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    SSN VARCHAR(11) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2 ENCRYPTED WITH (
        COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = MyCEK,
        ENCRYPTION_TYPE = Randomized,
        ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256'
    ) NOT NULL,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

Explanation:



COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY: Specifies the column encryption key.

ENCRYPTION_TYPE: Specifies the type of encryption (Randomized or Deterministic).

ALGORITHM: Specifies the encryption algorithm.


2. Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) in SQL Server

Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) in SQL Server encrypts the entire database, including backups and transaction log files. This method is transparent to the applications accessing the database, meaning no changes are required in the application code.


Example:



-- Enable TDE for a database
USE master;
GO
CREATE DATABASE EncryptionKey
ENCRYPTION = ON;
GO

Explanation:



ENCRYPTION = ON: Enables TDE for the database.


3. MySQL Encryption

MySQL supports encryption for data at rest and in transit. You can use functions like AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() to encrypt and decrypt data.


Example:



-- Encrypt and decrypt data in MySQL
INSERT INTO Users (username, encrypted_data)
VALUES ('john_doe', AES_ENCRYPT('Sensitive Data', 'encryption_key'));

SELECT username, AES_DECRYPT(encrypted_data, 'encryption_key') AS decrypted_data
FROM Users;

Explanation:



AES_ENCRYPT(): Encrypts the data using the specified key.

AES_DECRYPT(): Decrypts the data using the specified key.


4. Oracle Database Encryption

Oracle provides several methods for encrypting data, including Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and application-level encryption using the DBMS_CRYPTO package.


Example:



-- Encrypt data using DBMS_CRYPTO in Oracle
DECLARE
    v_encrypted_data RAW(2000);
    v_decrypted_data VARCHAR2(2000);
    v_key RAW(32) := HEXTORAW('0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF');
BEGIN
    -- Encrypt the data
    v_encrypted_data := DBMS_CRYPTO.ENCRYPT(
        src => UTL_I18N.STRING_TO_RAW('Sensitive Data', 'AL32UTF8'),
        typ => DBMS_CRYPTO.ENCRYPT_AES256 + DBMS_CRYPTO.CHAIN_CBC + DBMS_CRYPTO.PAD_PKCS5,
        key => v_key
    );

    -- Decrypt the data
    v_decrypted_data := UTL_I18N.RAW_TO_CHAR(
        DBMS_CRYPTO.DECRYPT(
            src => v_encrypted_data,
            typ => DBMS_CRYPTO.ENCRYPT_AES256 + DBMS_CRYPTO.CHAIN_CBC + DBMS_CRYPTO.PAD_PKCS5,
            key => v_key
        ),
        'AL32UTF8'
    );

    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Decrypted Data: ' || v_decrypted_data);
END;

Explanation:



DBMS_CRYPTO.ENCRYPT: Encrypts the data using the specified algorithm and key.

DBMS_CRYPTO.DECRYPT: Decrypts the data using the specified algorithm and key.


Using Encrypted Databases in VIGI A.I

To integrate encrypted databases into your VIGI A.I application, follow these steps:




Choose the Right Database: Depending on your application requirements, choose a database that supports the encryption methods you need (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle).




Set Up Encryption: Configure the encryption settings in your database. This may involve creating encryption keys, enabling TDE, or setting up Always Encrypted.




Modify Application Code: Ensure your application code can handle encrypted data. This may involve using specific functions to encrypt and decrypt data before storing or retrieving it from the database.




Secure Key Management: Implement secure key management practices to protect your encryption keys. Use hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure key vaults to store and manage your keys.




By using encrypted databases, you can ensure that the sensitive data used in your VIGI A.I application remains secure, protecting trade secrets and maintaining user privacy.
